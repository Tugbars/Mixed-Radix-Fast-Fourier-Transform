# mixed-radix-FFT
 HelixFFT is a lightweight, pure C Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) library designed for efficient signal processing across diverse input sizes. It implements a mixed-radix algorithm for lengths factorable by small primes (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8) and Bluesteinâ€™s algorithm for arbitrary lengths.
